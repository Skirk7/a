#The annual number of industrial accidents occurring in a particular manufacturing plant is known to
# follow Poisson distribution with mean 12.
#a)What is the probability of observing exactly 5 accidents at this plant during the coming year?
#b)What is the probability of observing not more than 12 accidents at this plant the coming year?
#c)What is the probability of observing at least 15 accidents at this plant during the coming year?
#d)What is the probability of observing between 10 and 15 accidents (inclusive) at this plant during the coming year?
